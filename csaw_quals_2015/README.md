# CSAW Qualification 2015

I played on the RPISEC2 team, which came in 8th of the qualifying teams.

Exploitation 100 (Precision) was solved by Josh Makinen, but a polished version of his script is included here as a libc dumper.

I solved Exploitation 250 (Contacts), Reversing 300 (FTP), and Exploitation 500 (Rhinoxorous) (in that order).
